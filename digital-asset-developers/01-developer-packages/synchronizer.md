# Canton Synchronizer (Domain)

**Purpose:** Host and operate subnetworks of the Canton Network

---

## Overview

A Synchronizer (formerly called "Domain" in Canton terminology) is a critical infrastructure component that coordinates transactions between multiple participant nodes in the Canton Network. It provides the consensus and ordering mechanism that enables atomic, cross-organization transactions while maintaining privacy.

---

## What is a Synchronizer?

### Core Concept
A Synchronizer is:
- **Transaction Coordinator** - Orders and sequences multi-party transactions
- **Consensus Provider** - Ensures all participants agree on transaction ordering
- **Privacy Mediator** - Facilitates transactions without seeing confidential data
- **Network Segment** - Creates isolated subnetworks within Canton

### Role in Canton Architecture
The Synchronizer:
- Does NOT see the contents of transactions (privacy-preserving)
- Provides ordering and sequencing services
- Ensures atomicity of multi-party workflows
- Enables horizontal scalability through multiple domains

---

## Key Capabilities

### Transaction Coordination
- **Ordering** - Establishes canonical transaction order
- **Sequencing** - Timestamps and sequences operations
- **Atomicity** - Ensures all-or-nothing transaction execution
- **Conflict Resolution** - Manages concurrent transaction attempts

### Network Management
- **Participant Onboarding** - Add new participants to the domain
- **Access Control** - Manage domain membership
- **Configuration** - Domain-wide settings and parameters
- **Monitoring** - Domain health and performance metrics

### Privacy Architecture
- **Blind Coordination** - Sequences transactions without seeing content
- **Selective Visibility** - Only transaction parties see details
- **Metadata Protection** - Minimizes information leakage
- **Cryptographic Guarantees** - Privacy through encryption

---

## Use Cases

### Public Synchronizers
- **Canton Network Main Domain** - Public shared infrastructure
- **Industry Domains** - Sector-specific coordination (finance, supply chain)
- **Regional Domains** - Geography-based domains for compliance
- **Test Networks** - Development and testing environments

### Private Synchronizers
- **Consortium Domains** - Private groups of organizations
- **Enterprise Domains** - Single organization with multiple business units
- **Partner Networks** - Limited membership domains
- **Compliance Zones** - Jurisdiction-specific domains

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **Sequencer** - Orders transactions and creates timestamps
2. **Mediator** - Validates transaction requests (without seeing content)
3. **Topology Manager** - Manages domain membership and configuration
4. **Database** - Stores sequencing and coordination data

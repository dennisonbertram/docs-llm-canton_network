# Canton Participant Node

**Purpose:** Host and operate a participant node to access applications on the Canton Network

---

## Overview

A Participant Node is a crucial component of the Canton blockchain protocol. It represents an entity (organization, business unit, or individual) on the Canton Network and provides the infrastructure necessary to participate in multi-party workflows, execute smart contracts, and maintain privacy-preserving ledger state.

## What is a Participant Node?

### Core Concept
A participant node is:
- **Identity Provider** - Represents a legal entity on the blockchain
- **Ledger Maintainer** - Maintains the participant's view of the ledger
- **Privacy Enforcer** - Ensures data is only visible to authorized parties
- **Transaction Processor** - Executes and validates smart contract transactions

### Canton Network Architecture
The Canton Network uses a unique architecture where:
- Each organization operates its own participant node
- Participants can join multiple synchronization domains
- Privacy is maintained through sub-transaction privacy
- Atomicity is preserved across domains

---

## Key Capabilities

### Privacy and Confidentiality
- **Sub-transaction Privacy** - Only parties to a transaction see the details
- **Selective Disclosure** - Control what information is shared
- **Data Isolation** - Each participant maintains their own data store
- **Encrypted Communication** - Secure data transmission between nodes

### Transaction Management
- Submit transactions to the network
- Validate incoming transactions
- Maintain transaction history
- Query ledger state

### Application Hosting
- Deploy and run Daml applications
- Expose APIs for client applications
- Manage user authentication and authorization
- Handle ledger queries and commands

---

## Use Cases

### Enterprise Blockchain Participation
- Financial institutions joining Canton Network
- Supply chain participants
- Multi-party settlement networks
- Consortium blockchain members

### Private Networks
- Internal enterprise blockchain networks
- Partner collaboration networks
- Industry-specific consortiums
- Regulated environment deployments
